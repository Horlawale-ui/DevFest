      <h2>Attending in Person</h2>
      <p>
        As this is a hybrid event, we have some requirements for in-person
        attendees to ensure the safety of all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and
        volunteers.
        <br />
        <br />
        All in-person attendees will be required to show proof of vaccination or
        a negative lateral flow test taken within the last 48 hours of the event
        starting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Everyone will be required to wear a mask (unless you have a previous
        proof of exemption) for the duration of the event when inside and not
        eating or drinking.
